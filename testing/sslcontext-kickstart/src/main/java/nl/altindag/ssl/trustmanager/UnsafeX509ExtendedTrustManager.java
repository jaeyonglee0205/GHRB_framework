/**
 * An insecure {@link UnsafeX509ExtendedTrustManager TrustManager} that trusts all X.509 certificates without any verification.
 * <p>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong>
 * Never use this {@link UnsafeX509ExtendedTrustManager} in production.
 * It is purely for testing purposes, and thus it is very insecure.
 * </p>
 * <br>
 * Suppressed warning: java:S4830 - "Server certificates should be verified during SSL/TLS connections"
 *                                  This TrustManager doesn't validate certificates and should not be used at production.
 *                                  It is just meant to be used for testing purposes and it is designed not to verify server certificates.
 *
 * <p>
 * <br>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong>
 * Please don't use this class directly as it is part of the internal API. Class name and methods can be changed any time.
 * Instead use the {@link nl.altindag.ssl.util.TrustManagerUtils TrustManagerUtils} which provides the same functionality
 * while it has a stable API because it is part of the public API.
 * </p>
